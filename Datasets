Neuroimaging Data Processing Pipeline
This repository supports the analysis of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the ABIDE and REST-meta-MDD datasets, preprocessed using DPARSF.

Datasets
1. ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)
Description: A multi-site open-access dataset for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research, containing structural and functional MRI data from patients and healthy controls.

Download: ABIDE I Dataset

Key Features:

Includes over 1,000 subjects across 17 international sites.

Data formats: NIfTI, phenotypic information in CSV.

2. REST-meta-MDD (Major Depressive Disorder)
Description: A large-scale rs-fMRI dataset for major depressive disorder research, aggregating multi-center data.

Download: REST-meta-MDD

Key Features:

Contains 1,300+ MDD patients and healthy controls.

Standardized preprocessing protocols (e.g., removal of scanner effects).

Preprocessing Tool
DPARSF (Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI)
Description: A MATLAB-based toolbox for rs-fMRI preprocessing and analysis, compatible with SPM and REST.

Download & Tutorials: DPARSF Demo Data

Key Functions:

Slice timing correction, realignment, normalization, smoothing.

Functional connectivity analysis (e.g., ALFF, ReHo).

Usage
Download datasets from the links above.

Preprocess data using DPARSF (refer to its documentation).

Run statistical analyses (e.g., group comparisons, machine learning models).
