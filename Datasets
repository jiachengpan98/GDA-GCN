#Neuroimaging Data Processing Pipeline
This repository supports the analysis of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the ABIDE and REST-meta-MDD datasets, preprocessed using DPARSF.

#Datasets
1. ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)
Description: A multi-site open-access dataset for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research, containing structural and functional MRI data from patients and healthy controls.

Download: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html

Key Features:

Includes over 1,000 subjects across 17 international sites.

Data formats: NIfTI, phenotypic information in CSV.

2. REST-meta-MDD (Major Depressive Disorder)
Description: A large-scale rs-fMRI dataset for major depressive disorder research, aggregating multi-center data.

Download:https://rfmri.org/REST-meta-MDD

Key Features:

Contains 1,300+ MDD patients and healthy controls.

Standardized preprocessing protocols (e.g., removal of scanner effects).

#Preprocessing Tool
DPARSF (Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI)
Description: A MATLAB-based toolbox for rs-fMRI preprocessing and analysis, compatible with SPM and REST.

Download & Tutorials: https://rfmri.org/content/demonstrational-data-resting-state-fmri

Key Functions:

Slice timing correction, realignment, normalization, smoothing.

Functional connectivity analysis (e.g., ALFF, ReHo).
